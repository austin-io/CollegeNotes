## Key Concepts
- **Anthropology**: The study of humans
- **Biological/Physical Anthropology Approach**: Evolutionary perspective

### Goals

1. Understand the biology of humans today
2. Study morphology, behavior, and diversity of humans

## Course Overview

### Three main parts

1. Process of evolution
2. Relatives
3. Course of human evolution

**Extra Credit**: [Zoo thingy] (Note: unclear what this refers to, please clarify)

**Exam Policy**: Exams are open note, can be printed out

## Objectives
- Understand what evolution is and is not
- Identify common misconceptions about evolution
- Brief history of evolutionary theory
- Evolution = **Change over time**

## Biological Evolution and Scientific Method

### Biological Evolution
**Definition**: Changes in the frequency of gene variants in a population over time. 

**Measured**: Changes in populations over time (across generations), not within individuals or within an individual's lifetime

### Cultural Evolution
Changes in cultural traditions over time

### The Scientific Method

#### Purpose
Construct an accurate, reliable, self-consistent, non-arbitrary representation of the world

#### Steps:
1. Observation
2. Question
3. Hypothesis
4. Prediction
5. Test/Experiment
6. Conclusion
7. Communicate

### Characteristics of a Scientific Theory
- Identifies a set of observations as phenomena
- Makes assertions about what causes or effects this phenomena

### Myths About Evolution
- **What Evolution is NOT**:
	- It's just a theory
	- No intermediate fossils
	- Humans evolved from monkeys
	- Evolution is Linear
	- Evolution solves all problems
	- Evolution is random

### Key Figures in Evolutionary Thought

#### Georges Cuvier (1769-1832):
- Developed ideas of:
    - Catastrophism
    - Extinction

#### Charles Lyell (1797-1875):
- Famous for the idea of:
    - Uniformitarianism
    - Suggested the Earth was very old

#### Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829):
- Known for:
    - Inheritance of acquired characteristics
    - Suggested that life evolved

#### Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778):
- Developed taxonomy
- Placed humans with primates
- Introduced binomial nomenclature (Homo sapiens)
- Believed in fixity of species

### Evolutionary Theory and Key Figures

#### Charles Darwin
- Joined the HMS Beagle as a volunteer naturalist in 1831 at 22 years old
- Influenced by:
	- **Lyell**: Uniformitarianism and the idea of an old Earth
	- **Malthus**: Population growth and the struggle for existence
- Studied artificial selection and applied it to nature
- Developed the theory of **evolution by natural selection**

#### Thomas Malthus
- Claimed that human population growth is exponential
- Food supply grows linearly, leading to a struggle for existence

#### Alfred Russel Wallace
- Independently developed the idea of evolution by natural selection
- Collaborated with Darwin to present their findings at the Royal Academy of Sciences meeting
- Darwin published *The Origin of Species* in 1859

## Key Dates
- 1831: Darwin joins the HMS Beagle
- 1859: Darwin publishes The Origin of Species
